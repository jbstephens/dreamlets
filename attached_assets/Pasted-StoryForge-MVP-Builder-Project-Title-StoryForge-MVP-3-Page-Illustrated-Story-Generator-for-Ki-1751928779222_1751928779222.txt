StoryForge MVP Builder

Project Title:
StoryForge MVP – 3-Page Illustrated Story Generator for Kids

⸻

Overview:
We’re building an AI-powered bedtime story creator. Parents define their kids and recurring characters (e.g. stuffies), input a story idea, and the app generates a short 3-part narrative with matching illustrations. Each story is rendered in a 3-page printable HTML layout with embedded images, optimized for printing or saving as PDF via the browser. No backend PDF generation required.

⸻

Key Features:

🧒 1. User Setup (Characters + Kids)
	•	Allow user to input and save:
	•	Kids: name, age, short description (e.g. “Loves space and cats”)
	•	Characters: name, type (manual or image upload), optional description
	•	Store these per user (use Supabase or Firebase for user auth + DB)
	•	Later stories pull from these profiles

⸻

📚 2. Story Generation Flow
	•	Input form includes:
	•	Select one or more kids
	•	Select optional characters (via pill UI)
	•	Input freeform story idea
	•	Option to select tone: cozy / funny / adventure / dreamy
	•	Bonus: show 3 suggested ideas if no input is given
	•	When user submits:
	•	GPT generates a story in 3 parts:
	1.	Setup
	2.	Climax
	3.	Resolution
	•	Each part includes a corresponding illustration description
	•	scene_intro
	•	scene_climax
	•	scene_conclusion
	•	AI art generator (e.g. DALL·E or Midjourney API) returns 3 images

⸻

🖼️ 3. Story Rendering
	•	Display the story in a 3-page view using styled HTML/CSS
	•	Each page includes:
	•	1/3 of the story text
	•	1 centered image
	•	Clean serif font, kid-friendly layout
	•	Page breaks using page-break-after: always
	•	Add a fixed button: “Print / Save as PDF” → uses window.print()
	•	@media print CSS hides buttons and ensures good pagination

⸻

💾 4. Data Storage

Each story record should include:
	•	id
	•	title
	•	child_ids
	•	character_ids
	•	story_part_1, story_part_2, story_part_3
	•	image_url_1, image_url_2, image_url_3
	•	created_at
	•	part_of_collection (for later storybook printing)

⸻

Stretch Goals (Optional for V1):
	•	“Add to Storybook” button that queues stories for future multi-story PDF
	•	Story continuity: optionally pass prior story titles/summary into GPT prompt
	•	Narration audio button (ElevenLabs or similar)

⸻

Stack Suggestions:
	•	Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind
	•	Auth + DB: Supabase
	•	AI: OpenAI (GPT-4o), DALL·E 3 API (or Midjourney via webhook workaround)
	•	Deployment: Vercel

⸻

Success Criteria for MVP:
	•	A parent can:
	•	Input their kids and favorite characters
	•	Generate a 3-part bedtime story with 3 relevant images
	•	View the story in a beautiful 3-page layout
	•	Print or save as PDF fro
